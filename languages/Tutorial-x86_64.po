"\n"
"1: Open Cheat Engine if it currently isn't running.\n"
"2: Click on the \"Open Process\" icon (it's the top-left icon with the computer on it, below \"File\".).\n"
"3: With the Process List window now open, look for this tutorial's process in the list. It will look something like \"00001F98-Tutorial-x86_64.exe\" or \"0000047C-Tutorial-i386.exe\". (The first 8 numbers/letters will probably be different.)\n"
"4: Once you've found the process, click on it to select it, then click the \"Open\" button. (Don't worry about all the other buttons right now. You can learn about them later if you're interested.)\n"

"Congratulations! If you did everything correctly, the process window should be gone with Cheat Engine now attached to the tutorial (you will see the process name towards the top-center of CE).\n"

"This step will explain how to deal with code that is used for other object of the same type\n"
"\n"
"Often when you've found health of a unit or your own player, you will find that if you remove the code, it affects enemies as well.\n"
"In these cases you must find out how to distinguish between your and the enemies objects.\n"
"Sometimes this is as easy as checking the first 4 bytes (Function pointer table) which often point to a unique location for the player, and sometimes it's a team number, or a pointer to a pointer to a pointer to a pointer to a pointer to a playername. It all depends on the complexity of the game, and your luck\n"
"\n"
"The easiest method is finding what addresses the code you found writes to and then use the dissect data feature to compare against two structures. (Your unit(s)/player and the enemies) And then see if you can find out a way to distinguish between them.\n"
"When you have found out how to distinguish between you and the computer you can inject an assembler script that checks for the condition and then either do not execute the code or do something else. (One hit kills for example)\n"
"Alternatively, you can also use this to build a so called \"Array of byte\" string which you can use to search which will result in a list of all your or the enemies players\n"
"In this tutorial I have implemented the most amazing game you will ever play.\n"
"It has 4 players. 2 Players belong to your team, and 2 Players belong to the computer. \n"

"In the previous step I explained how to use the Code finder to handle changing locations. But that method alone makes it difficult to find the address to set the values you want.\n"
"That's why there are pointers:\n"
"\n"
"At the bottom you'll find 2 buttons. One will change the value, and the other changes the value AND the location of the value.\n"
"For this step you don't really need to know assembler, but it helps a lot if you do.\n"
"\n"
"First find the address of the value. When you've found it use the function to find out what accesses this address.\n"
"Change the value again, and an item will show up in the list. Double click that item. (or select and click on more info) and a new window will open with detailed information on what happened when the instruction ran.\n"
"If the assembler instruction doesn't have anything between a '[' and ']' then use another item in the list.\n"
"If it does it will say what it think will be the value of the pointer you need.\n"
"Go back to the main cheat engine window (you can keep this extra info window open if you want, but if you close it, remember what is between the '[' and ']' ) and do a 4 byte scan in hexadecimal for the value the extra info told you.\n"
"When done scanning it may return 1 or a few hundred addresses. Most of the time the address you need will be the smallest one. Now click on the \"Add Address Manually\" button and select the pointer checkbox.\n"
"\n"
"The window will change and allow you to type in the address of a pointer and an offset.\n"
"Fill in the address you just found. It can be in the form: \"Tutorial-i386.exe\"+xxxxxx (relative to the process), \n"
"or you can double click the address to add it to the address list and use the absolute address which appears there.\n"
"If the assembler instruction has a calculation (e.g: [esi+12]) at the end then type the value in that's at the end above the address field. This is the offset. Otherwise leave it 0. If it was a more complicated instruction look at the following calculation.\n"
"\n"
"Example of a more complicated instruction:\n"
"[EAX*2+EDX+00000310] eax=4C and edx=00801234.\n"
"In this case EDX would be the value the pointer has, and EAX*2+00000310 the offset, so the offset you'd fill in would be 2*4C+00000310=3A8. (This is all in hex, use calc.exe from Windows in Programmer mode to calculate hex values.)\n"
"\n"
"Back to the tutorial, click OK and the address will be added. If all went right the address will show P->xxxxxxx, with xxxxxxx being the address of the value you found. If that's not right, you've done something wrong.\n"
"Now, change the value using the pointer you added in to 5000 and click in the 'Active' coloumn to freeze it. Then click Change pointer, and if all went right the Next button will become visible.\n"

"Notice the alloc, that will allocate a block of memory for your code cave, in the past, in the pre windows 2000 systems, people had to find code caves in the memory (regions of memory unused by the game), but that's luckily a thing of the past since windows 2000, and will these days cause errors when trying to be used, due to SP2 of XP and the NX bit of new CPUs.\n"
"\n"
"Also notice the line newmem: and originalcode: and the text \"Place your code here\".\n"
"As you guessed it, write your code here that will increase the health with 2.\n"
"A useful assembler instruction in this case is the \"ADD instruction\".\n"
"\n"
"Here are a few examples:\n"
"\"ADD [00901234],9\" to increase the address at 00901234 with 9\n"
"\"ADD [ESP+4],9\" to increase the address pointed to by ESP+4 with 9\n"
"In this case, you'll have to use the same thing between the brackets as the original code has that decreases your health.\n"
"\n"
"Notice:\n"
"It is recommended to delete the line that decreases your health from the original code section, else you'll have to increase your health with 3 (you increase with 3, the original code decreases with 1, so the end result is increase with 2), which might become confusing. But it's all up to you and your programming.\n"
"\n"
"Notice 2:\n"
"In some games the original code can exist out of multiple instructions, and sometimes, not always, it might happen that a code at another place jumps into your jump instruction end will then cause unknown behavior. If that happens, you should usually look near that instruction and see the jumps and fix it, or perhaps even choose to use a different address to do the code injection from. As long as you're able to figure out the address to change from inside your injected code.\n"

"This step will explain how to use multi-level pointers.\n"
"In step 6 you had a simple level-1 pointer, with the first address found already being the real base address.\n"
"This step however is a level-4 pointer. It has a pointer to a pointer to a pointer to a pointer to a pointer to the health.\n"
"\n"
"You basicly do the same as in step 6. Find out what accesses the value, look at the instruction and what probably is the base pointer value, and what is the offset, and already fill that in or write it down. But in this case the address you'll find will also be a pointer. You just have to find out the pointer to that pointer exactly the same way as you did with the value. Find out what accesses that address you found, look at the assembler instruction, note the probable instruction and offset, and use that.\n"
"And continue till you can't get any further (usually when the base address is a static address, shown up as green.)\n"
"\n"
"Click Change Value to let the tutorial access the health.\n"
"If you think you've found the pointer path click Change Register. The pointers and value will then change and you'll have 3 seconds to freeze the address to 5000.\n"

"Extra: This problem can also be solved using an auto assembler script, or using the pointer scanner.\n"
"Extra2: In some situations it is recommended to change CE's Codefinder settings to Access violations when \n"
"encountering instructions like mov eax,[eax] since debug registers show it AFTER it was changed, making it hard to find out the value of the pointer.\n"

"Extra3: If you're still reading. You might notice that when looking at the assembler instructions that the pointer is being read and filled out in the same codeblock (same routine, if you know assembler, look up till the start of the routine). This doesn't always happen, but can be really useful in finding a pointer when debugging is troublesome.\n"
